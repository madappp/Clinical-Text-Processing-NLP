What is 
Biomedical/Clinical Text 
Processing?


Biomedical/Clinical text mining
(BioNLP) is the study of how NLP
techniques are applied to texts and
literature of the biomedical and
molecular biology domains.

Clinical reports (EHRs) have a lot of
information about patients: family
background, disease and treatment
results, interpretation of test
images, behaviour and much more.

Tasks and Challenges in BioNLP
Negation Detection: It is an important problem in BioNLP as many clinical statements are 
written as the absence of certain disease. Formally, it is a classification task.
Word Sense Disambiguation: Abbreviations are common in biomedical documents, and many 
are ambiguous in the sense that they have several potential expansions.
Information Retrieval: This is the task of extracting and encoding information from clinical 
narratives, journals, EHRs, discharge summaries, or medical reports
Named Entity Recognition: Identification of entities like diseases, genes, chemicals, drugs 
and symptoms in the given text. It is particularly a complex problem as entities in biomedical 
domain are often described using long phrases consisting of punctuation and characters.
Clinical Coding: The task of translating clinical statements into a set of codes, as defined in 
international standards. We will see more about Clinical Coding in upcoming slides.
